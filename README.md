# How to build
IVA is developed in HTML5, therefore it is mainly developed in JavaScript and makes a heavy usage of HTML and CSS. It uses Grunt as building tool. IVA also requires of OpenCB JSorolla project to be built, this is a JavaScript library developed for several OpenCB web-based projects, this can be found as Git submodule in IVA.

Stable releases are merged and tagged at _master_ branch, you are encourage to use latest stable release for production. Current active development is carried out at _develop_ branch, only building is guaranteed and bugs are expected, use this branch for development or for testing new functionalities. The only dependency of IVA from OpenCB is JSorolla.

### Prerequisites
The following technologies are needed to build IVA: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/), [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Bower](https://bower.io/) and [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started).

##### Installing Node.js and npm
To install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) you can visit [this link](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-linux).

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) stands for *node packaged modules* and it is the dependency manager of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).

##### Install Bower
After installing Node.js and npm, we can install Bower by executing the following commands with root permission:

```
$ sudo npm install -g bower
```

##### Install Grunt
To install grunt, run

```
 npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### Cloning
IVA is an open-source project and can be downloaded either as package(tar.gz) from GitHub releases or source code by cloning the repository.

Default ***develop*** branch can be downloaded by executing:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/opencb/iva.git
Cloning into 'iva'...
remote: Counting objects: 624, done.
remote: Total 624 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 624
Receiving objects: 100% (624/624), 139.37 KiB | 0 bytes/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (356/356), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

Latest stable release at ***master*** branch can be downloaded by executing:

```
$ git clone -b master https://github.com/opencb/iva.git
Cloning into 'iva'...
remote: Counting objects: 624, done.
remote: Total 624 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 624
Receiving objects: 100% (624/624), 139.37 KiB | 191.00 KiB/s, done.
Resolving deltas: 100% (356/356), done.
Checking connectivity... done.
```

After this, in both cases, you **must** execute the following command to fetch the JSorolla submodule (only the first time):
 
```
git submodule update --init
```

Go to lib/jsorolla and checkout to ***develop*** branch of Jsorolla by 

```
cd lib/jsorolla
git checkout next-v2.0.0
```

### Build
First, you must update JSorolla dependencies, from the root folder execute:

```
cd lib/jsorolla
npm install
bower install
grunt
```

Finally, to build IVA execute:

We have to install npm packages for IVA, from the the root folder execute:

```
npm install
```

This will make npm to look at file [package.json](https://github.com/opencb/iva/blob/develop/package.json) and install locally all the dependencies listed there.

To install all *Bower* dependencies for IVA execute from the root folder:

```
bower install
```

This will make Bower to look at file [bower.json](https://github.com/opencb/iva/blob/develop/bower.json) and install locally all the dependencies.

At last execute:

```
grunt
```

When completed, all compiled files will be located under the build folder.

### Testing
You can copy build content to a web server such as Apache HTTP Server and open your favourite internet browser to open IVA.
