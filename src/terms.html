            <h2>Terms of use</h2>
            <p>Allele frequency data is released openly for the benefit of the wider biomedical community and we encourage the use and publication of results generated from these data.</p>

            <p>This data set has been subjected to extensive quality control (see <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/507244v1.supplementary-material" target="_blank">supplementary information</a>)
                but if you see any result indicating a processing or variant-calling artifact
                please <a href="mailto:wgs@bioresource.nihr.ac.uk">email</a> and we will do our best to address the issue.
                For bug reports, please file an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/opencb/iva/issues" target="_blank">IVA issue tracker</a>.</p>

            <h2>Citation in publications</h2>
            <p>We request that any use of data obtained from the Rare Disease genomes browser cite the bioRxiv <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/507244v1" target="_blank">paper</a>.
                This will be updated when a peer reviewed version is published.</p>
            <p>There is no need to include us as authors on your manuscript, unless we contributed specific advice or analysis for your work.
                However, we ask that the Consortium be acknowledged in publications as follows:
            <p>“This research was made possible through access to the data and findings generated by two pilot studies for the 100,000 Genomes Project.
                The enrolment for one pilot study was coordinated by the NIHR BioResource and the other by Genomics England Limited (GEL),
                a wholly owned company of the Department of Health in the UK. These studies were mainly funded by grants from the
                National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) in England, with additional funding provided by the BHF, MRC, NHS England,
                the Wellcome Trust and many other fund providers. The studies use data provided by patients and their close relatives collected
                by the NHS and other healthcare providers as part of their care and support. The vast majority of participants have been enrolled
                in the NIHR BioResource. We thank all volunteers for their participation, and also gratefully acknowledge NIHR Biomedical Research Centres,
                NIHR BioResource Centres, NHS Trust Hospitals, NHS Blood and Transplant and staff for their contribution.
                This research has been conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under Application Number 9616, granting access to DNA samples and
                accompanying participant data. UK Biobank has received funding from the MRC, Wellcome Trust, Department of Health,
                British Heart Foundation (BHF), Diabetes UK, Northwest Regional Development Agency, Scottish Government, and Welsh Assembly Government.
                The MRC and Wellcome Trust played a key role in the decision to establish UK Biobank.”</p>
