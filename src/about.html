            <p><a href="https://bioresource.nihr.ac.uk/rare-diseases/rare-diseases/" target="_blank">The NIHR BioResource for Rare Diseases</a> has been established with the aim to identify protein-coding and non-coding sequence
                variation underlying rare diseases, improve diagnostics and enable the development of treatment.</p>

            <p>The preprint paper <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/507244v1" target="_blank">Whole-genome sequencing of rare disease patients in a national healthcare system</a> describes in detail the generation and analysis of 13,037 30x whole genome sequences.
                These were derived from 9,802 adults and children diagnosed with a rare disease or their relatives.</p>
            <p>This web site provides access to genome-wide allele frequency sequence variation identified in the set of 10,259 unrelated individuals from this rare disease cohort.</p>

            <p>For bug reports, please file an issue on the <a href="https://github.com/opencb/iva/issues" target="_blank">IVA issue tracker</a>.</p>
